There are some projects I did related to finance.

- #### Pair trading system for futures based on CTP interface

  This is an execution system of trading inter-temporal futures contract in China. It is based on the CTP interface supplied by Shanghai Futures Information Technology Co., Ltd. I chose the C++ as the main programming language for this system and the QT as the interactive interface and the UI. This display language of this system is Chinese because all my partners (who want to use this system ) are Chinese. The idea of this project is from all partners but all the codes of this project are from myself, so I will not published all the codes of this project. This GitHub project will describe this trading system for anyone who is interested in.
